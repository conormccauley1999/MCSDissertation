      "28 1 How the hell does some other reviewer have 86 hours...the game just came out?\n",
      "28 1 This game has a LOT of potential. Crazy how only one person has made this so far. There were a few things I'm not sure was intentional or not like being able to fly around the map by spamming SHIFT + A + S + SPACE or something like that. I think it made the bosses easier because I was able to just shoot a lot and then SHIFT into some geometry and fly across the map but it was still a lot of fun. Can't wait for the full release! Should probably let you know that this is more of a Demo than a full game. I was able to finish it in about 50 minutes. Still worth picking it up.\n",
      "28 1 Are you seriously not going to buy the new Half-Life game that took 13 years to release?\n",
      "28 1 Great VR game! Should definitely be in everyone's VR list even if they play it rarely. There are two issues I've noticed though: 1) Hands often get stuck in game because I didn't realise they were behind a wall or something. I don't believe there is any feedback for this so it was quite annoying while trying to climb across a wall. 2) There is a lot happening in this game so I recommend you try both the seated and standing options. I played in standing for a majority of my run so far and it is literally the only VR game to make me nauseous. Aside from those, awesome game!\n",
      "28 1 An awesome remake of the Spyro Trilogy. I've only played \"Year of the Dragon\" so far but it is definitely worth picking up. I got it for 12$ but I would have totally bought it full price. It took me 10 years to finish \"Year of the Dragon.\" I only got halfway through it on my grandma's Playstation before it broke. Thanks for giving me nostalgia + the chance to finish the game! :)\n",
      "28 1 Late review but loved this game when the beta was open. There were a few things I'd change, i.e. Auto kick players who just sit in lobbies. I ran into that issue a lot. There are a lot of kids in this game but that doesn't ruin the fun as much as you would think. Gameplay as both the neighbour and as a kid was fun. Found being the neighbour more enjoyable. I did find it annoying when the entire team would all be \"braves.\" Made it difficult to catch them. If you have the spare money and are thinking about picking this game up when it comes out, I'd say go for it!\n",

      "28 0 I want to recommend this game, I really do, but there is no active community. Everything else about this game is amazing. I'd still pick it up if I were you. It could be a great game with friends or at LAN parties.\n",

      "17290 1 Decent RTS, a bit to simplified for my taste = no upgrades for units, basically 2 buildings one for infrantry one for mechs, yet campaign imo is interesting and worth trying.  On other hand multiplayer got boring and repetetive after just a few matches :/   + enjoyable and unique campaign for 3 factions + overall mechs concepts are quite interesting + interesting story + destructible environments    - terrible AI in skirmish. You can win easy with only basic infratry vs Hardest AI - no build structure  - no upgrades, skill tree, just rush mechs and usually gg. - boring multiplayer Overall rating: 6/10\n",
      "17290 0 In current state this is more neutral than positive or negative review. It's a decent game. If you are a big Marvel/Avengers fan it's must have for you but rest average/casual gamers should wait for bug fixes, more content or big sale. + good story + Ms. Marvel is way more interesting/likeable character than i though it would be + enjoyable, unique combat for each avenger + everything unloackable by just playing  - 3-4 first hours of campaign are great and last mision too, but everything between them are extremely disappointing - matmachaking barely works, better just find somebody and invite them manually - buggy as hell - most skins are MEH, basically 3 different outfits with 20 recolors - spider-man exclusive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥\n",

Your goal is to build a colony that can survive in zombie apocalypse world for some period of time. + unique post-apo world + great steampunk artstyle + works pretty well for amounts of units we see sometimes on the screen + enjoyable gameplay ( mix between tower defense and classic RTS  )  + very addictive + random generating map + high difficulty  - big lack of units ( currently we got 6 )  - same with buidings ( though its not that bad, just wish for more turrets type ) - would like see some more options to adjust my expierence in survival mode like map size,more hordes, amount of resources on the map etc.  Game at this point its pretty good and when devs will add more content into it ( hopping for steam workshop support)  its gonna be just a great expierence. Highly recommended for any RTS fans.  Will update this review later at release or so.\n",
      "17290 1 Definitely best    in last year's. Big open world, finally interesting side quests and other activities.  + steam achievements ( finally! first Assassin's Creed game that have them ) + difficulty settings ( same as above ) + likeable and interesting main character Bayek  + awesome big world with plenty of activities set in ancient Egypt + really enjoyable gameplay + new combat system ( its not perfect though ) + big variety in weapons + looks great + sounds great + RPG elements  + photo mode  - can't kill chickens ( yup!) - microtranscations ( you can buy some costumes, mounts, boost to exp/money etc. basically nothing special but its there.....) - well some side quest could use some more work\n",

Perfectly fits for this game) - Six large city regions to fight through, complete with shops and side quests! (Not that large though, and it's only one side quest per city) - Loads of weapons, items, and abilities to power-up your heroines! (Useless) + Guest appearances by classic River City characters! (I don't know most of them, but it's a point plus I guess) For those of you who aren't fan of this series or this genre just wait for the sale, it is a short game if you don't want to 100% completion.\n",
      "126400 1 Better than Kiwami but still can't surpass Yakuza 0 even with the new engine. 9/10\n",
      "126400 1 10/10 SOUNDTRACK 10/10 FEELS\n",
      "126400 1 This is a game for those who like anime and turn-based strategy. Story:  Average. Slow paced. Forced drama and forced romance.  Kinda disappointing. Gameplay:  Super fun.  High replay value.  Sometimes can be hard. Lots of characters you can play. Music: The weakest part of the game. There are no notable and memorable song in this game. 8,5/10\n",
      "126400 1 This is a story of mad/sad scientist from beta worldline before he reaches the Steins;Gate (true end of the original Steins;Gate).  El Psy Kongroo 8,5/10\n",

      "126400 1 龍が如く 極2 PC版でお願いします!!! 9/10\n",
      "126400 1 Better than the previous Tomb Raider (2013) game. The gameplay little bit improved, and the story is good enough to follow. The graphics is so good for a game that released 4 years ago, sadly my PC couldn't handle on highest setting.  8,5/10\n",
      "261875 1 It's pretty hard and there's a bit of a learning curve, but I really enjoy the tactical aspect. I gave up on using a controller though; it makes aiming significantly harder compared to using keyboard and mouse.\n",
      "261875 1 It surely isn't easy, but you steadily get the hang of it and then it's all the more satisfying to hit that birdie or eagle. Great step up from the previous games and very happy I purchased it.\n",
      "261875 1 Compared to its prequel, HITMAN 2 has a much more eleborate and compelling story line. I'm glad, 'cause that was the main weakness in the previous game. Playing through the various missions was as entertaining as before, perhaps even more so.  It's not a whole lot of content given the price tag, but bearing in mind everything that IO Interactive went through this past year, I enjoyed giving them my money anyway. That said, the game does feel rough around the edges. You'll find NPC's speaking in a local accent, then suddenly have an American voice for generic sentences. Often if you interact with an NPC while he's in conversation, he'll begin talking to you and continue its previous conversation at the same time, as if he had two mouths. Stuff like that. I guess they were pretty stretched thin at the end of development. Don't remember any such imperfections in the last game.\n",
      "261875 0 Couldn't even get the game to start. What are these devs up to?\n",
      "261875 1 A retrospective tale that shares the joys, doubts and fears of the author's life. It's candid throughout, often confusing and occasionally funny. Short but provocative, though quite abstract. A very off-beat experience that is somewhat light on gameplay. Having done a single playthrough, I don't necessarily feel much sense of accomplishment, but there are parts of the game that I would replay and share with friends, which I believe is what the author set out to do.\n",
      "261875 1 The Promised Land is cute and fun, despite it being incredibly slow paced. Expanding your production chains and tweaking their efficiency is rewarding and not too much hassle. I'm not sure whether I will finish this game, but I have enjoyed it so far. I'd recommend it, especially when it's on sale.\n",
      "261875 1 I am quite sure everyone who has played Metal Gear Solid V feels just like I do: \"I am so prepared to love you! Why do you keep spitting in my face?\"  This could have been the best game ever if only they didn't try so hard to shove those microtransactions down your throat. Just buy it, play it, pass on any DLC's and in-game credits and pray to god that Japan will outlaw microtransactions before they finish working on the sequel.\n",
      "261875 1 This game is kinda weird, but in a nice way. It's playful, soothing and invites you to explore.  It doesn't challange you all that much and is quite light on game mechanics, but that is to be expected of a casual and abstract indie game. Don't let it keep you from enjoying the bright, colorful world that is Shu's Garden.\n",
      "261875 0 It's great. I really like it. But it's so short, if you have a free afternoon, you'll likely finish it in a single playthrough. That'll unlock some new stuff, so your next playthrough will be slightly different. But having another shot at the campaign will reset your ranks and choices, making you lose some sense of progression. It's hard to feel invested in your decisions if you know that they'll only matter for a little while. The story, cut scenes, voice acting, they're all really cool.  But they're not that appealing when you know where the story's gonna go. Where does that leave me? Invisible Inc. is good. You'll enjoy it. But it's twenty bucks at the moment. The upcoming DLC will add to the campaign, but it won't be free. As such I personally wouldn't recommend you buy it. That isn't to say that if you don't really care about the price, you won't have a great time. Because you will.\n",
      "261875 0 Homesick immediately appealed to my inner detective. I purchased it instantly, hoping to relive the intense joy of playing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, which in much ways seemed similar to this game. For those who played \"Ethan Carter\" as well, you will remember how the puzzles and gameplay were contributing to your comprehesion of the story. Slowly uncovering the truth was an incredibly rewarding experience. This is where Homesick vastly differs. Its puzzles remind you of that point-and-click adventure you once bought but barely played. Once again you'll find yourself revisiting every area, clicking on every object in the hope something will happen. You'll wonder why the game isn't progressing and finally discover it was waiting for you to -whatever- water a plant or something. While the dreams (interactive cutscenes) give away the story pretty quickly, discovering the solution to a puzzle won't help your comprehension at all. Homesick features a linear progressing story, invisible walls, simple yet tedious puzzles and slow gameplay, As such, I'm afraid I did not enjoy it.\n",
      "280165 1 I played a bit of campaign during Early Access but now I started freeroam to just relax. And yeah, it's exactly as I imagined it would be. It's still Starpoint Gemini but more up close and personal. I'm not conquering regions, but rather trying to find my place in this cold universe. It's big, it's cool and it's dangerous. With excellent music from Nikola Nikita Jeremic, I'm really enjoying it, despite I don't have as much time to play as before.\n",
      "280165 1 It's everything I expected Serious Sam game to be. It's fun, it has cheesy dialogues, thousands of enemies, big guns and non stop carnage.  Someone said the graphics is outdated, but I don't mind it, I like the graphics because it has that old Sam look&feel. I would recommend this title to everyone that liked previous ones.  There are new features, you have skill points, dual wielding of big weapons and everything is bigger and better than in the last one. Get in here and inflict some serious damage. :)\n",
      "280165 1 This is a classic open world RPG, but it's so charming and cute that it's addictive! Recommended! Pawsome game! Meow!\n",
      "280165 1 It's simple and fun, but not even close to the awesomeness of the movie. Still, it reminds me of old arcade fight games. :)\n",
      "280165 1 I didn't clock many hours in yet, but so far this is quite a breathe of fresh air. I was afraid WASD control scheme will be a turnoff, but it actually works quite well and intuitive. Graphics are beautiful and so are effects and other visuals. Characters are interesting and beautifully drawn and the story is pretty good so far.  I have to admit, I like Pagan. I'm playing with Anya mostly, since I never played necromancer in Diablo, this is new to me, but fun. Speaking of Diablo, this is not another Path of Exile or Diablo clone. It's a new game and it's pretty good so far. I'm looking forward to see how the game will grow.  Music is also very nice, even epic at some points and since I never turn off game music, I'm glad when I get the chance to really enjoy it. :)\n",
      "280165 1 Very fun and very stable although it was beta. I ran it in building mode for over 60 hours without exiting and I loved every minute of it. :) Will buy on first sale.\n",
      "280165 1 First of all, Tankorama was made by two of my friends with I love and respect so I might be a little biased. Anyway, Tankorama is cool. It reminds me of those old arcade machine games, some of which I still have and play on my RetroPie and Amiga 1200 like 1942 game, or even Space Invaders. Graphics are nice, sounds could be a bit better, but I like the humor. For example Tutlek in croatian means someone who's confused, even stupid. And you have General Tutlek in the game. I like the art because I like the artist, screw it, no reason to lie about that. We both worked together on games like Starpoint Gemini 2 and Starpoint Gemini Warlords so if you like the art, check those games too. :)  As one of my friends said, this is one of those \"one more and I'm off to bed\" games which can become addictive pretty fast and keep you up for hours.  Playing with mouse and keyboard is smooth, but controller needed some work and programmer listened and sorted out some things before release. Kudos for that. Anyway, this is not new Bioware game, but this is not Fallout 76 fail either. This is a fun little arcade game, pretty hard for old farts like me, but fun nevertheless. And for this price it offers a fair amount of levels, weapons, enemies and stuff to blow up.  P.S. They've sorted some minor bugs so the game is even better now. :)\n",
      "280165 1 Cool idea, I have it for some time now, it has beautiful wallpapers.  If you love space, check out this collection -  Cheers! And recommended!\n",
      "280165 1 I'm not done yet, I'm playing slowly through side missions and I enjoy the game so far. New adventure of Lara, what can go wrong? :D Gameplay is smooth and controls are easy to learn. You have several difficulty settings for each aspect of the game like combat, exploration.... Good game by a good team. Can't wait to finish the story, but I won't rush it. :)\n",
      "280165 1 Absolutely better than any dino park I've seen so far. And it's licensed, it has Jeff Goldblum, community is run by my dear friends Ed and Bo and this is yet another successful Frontier game. I just started so I will update my review at a later time, but so far, I'm enjoying it. It's not as complex as Planet Coaster, but some might find that a plus. This is more casual.\n",

      "1518820 1 Portal 2 is a masterpiece, a work of art that you will love for its ingenious story pop-culture, references to logical puzzles and co-op multiplayer.\n",
      "1518820 1 The consistent thrill of Saints Row IV is how it constantly, eagerly, happily, accommodatingly asks you “Hey, how do you want to break the game now?” And for a game so colossal, so occasionally dumb, so often colossally sharks-with-laser-beams-on-their-heads-that-can-also-breathe-fire-and-fly-and-turn-invisible-and-you-can-even-ride-them dumb, what an incredibly smart thing to do with an open world, a franchise, and a story.\n",
      "1518820 1 A real challenge to... you know, that other sandbox game... Saints Row 2 expands on the original with a dizzying level of complexity. Stilwater is back and bigger than ever - there's so much to see and do you'll be entertained for hours.\n",
      "1518820 1 Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 delivers the very same concept that made the first episode enjoyable for all the Sniper Elite fans out there, with very few changes indeed.\n",
      "1518820 1 In closing, Sniper Elite V2 does a lot of things right. The tactical components have been well thought out, despite predictable enemy AI upsetting the balance somewhat. Minor issues aside, headshot enthusiasts and stealth fans will find much to love here.\n",
      "1518820 1 It might look dead on the outside, but the systemic mechanical genius of State of Decay is gloriously alive and kicking.\n",
      "1518820 1 To put it briefly: The New Order deserves a sequel. And to make sure this dream comes true, I can do only one thing: convince you to buy the new Wolfensten game. Perhaps great trailers boosted expectations too high, perhaps fanatical Return to Castle Wolfenstein players won't be as amazed, as I am, but I'm sure of this: all FPS fans will have a great time and after finishing the game they'll want more.\n",
      "1518820 1 Skyrim is definitely one of the best games of 2011, but if the DLC holds out, it might just be one of the best games of 2012 as well. It is the best open world RPG you can get. A true evolution of genre is not flawless but still it is the game you love to live in.\n",
      "1518820 1 I found Deadlight very entertaining, and consider it one of the best platformers I have ever played. I highly recommend it to pretty much anyone who likes the sound of a fast-paced horror action platformer that also has a decent story and amazing visuals, i could not tear myself away from the screen.\n",

      "1843165 1 I have been playing Destiny since Year 1 back in 2014 on Console and played it through all of Destiny 2's launch till current season of this post which is Season of Arrivals. Destiny whether it was Destiny 1 or 2 both games had their up's and downs for gameplay exhaustion/lack of content, but this game franchise always had something about it that just kept me interested. Even in times of lack of content there was always something to chase for whether it be a very rare shader for your gun or armor, random rolls to get god rolls on guns/armor or that one exotic that you just can never seem to get to drop. Destiny is a game geared towards people who love long grinds and content that may not always be big in quantity, but big in rarity.  I never really was into MMO styled games during my life, but destiny was one of the few I liked (and yes I know its not a \"True\" MMO as its more of a hybrid MMO thats a looter shooter) I found the experiences of going through raids and dungeons for the first time with friends or randoms to be a very exciting and once in a lifetime experience that I love doing every time there is a new Raid/Dungeon added to the game. If you are someone who loves those kind of things in other MMO games then you may enjoy Destiny's experience of them. The community has some good people in it willing to help those who do not understand out when they look for people to teach them. Though sadly like any popular game there is trolls and toxic people still but you just have to look past that like any other game.  In my honest opinion I find that right now destiny is in a good spot (not it's best that was probably either Taken King in D1 or Forsaken back in 2018) but right now is a good time to get back into Destiny 2 for anyone who has not played for a while or for people who have never played destiny as this is the final season before the next major Expansion Beyond Light coming this Stept. I recommend this game to anyone who has the time and is interested in long grinds and gameplay similar to games of the genre of looter shooter. Plus its Free these days so there is no pain in trying out the game if you have not yet.\n",
      "1843165 1 At the time of writing this I have only finished 2 routes in 1 of the 3 games in this and i have to say that 14 hours in and im no where near done. This game is very worth it in my honest opinion if you are a fan the series. It lets you have those moments from the anime where you wished Shido would actually end up with a specific girl and see what would happen. Now don't go into this thinking you will be getting a very high quality VN like Clannad or Grisaia series as this game is not as deep in story as those ones are, but it is a very fun game if you like to kick back and read it like watching the anime's only difference being you got to make choices for shido that wont make him look like a idiot. All and all though if your looking for a Date a Live experience where you can see your favorite girl or spirit in a new way and see how the \"What If\" scenarios could of been for Shido and a specific girl, then this is the game for you. Not to mention the price is pretty great considering you get 3 full VNs. would recommend solely for being able to date Kurumi\n",
      "1843165 1 Amazing game just how i remembered it on 360 but with even more content now i just need Xillia 1 and 2 on PC and im satsified with the series.\n",
      "1843165 1 I highly recommend this game for anyone that loves a mix of WW2ish like setting, Anime, and the first Valkyria chronicles. I spent at the time of this post 42 hours playing the game. Valkyria Chronicles 4 tells a really compelling story about a squad of friends who all enlisted in the army to protect their home, friends, and family. The game does a excellent job at grabing at your emotions and gets you really invested into the characters and story. For me it just made me want to keep playing each day to find out what happens next its like watching a really good anime but you have to play at times though is the catch. One of my favorite things the devlopers have done with this game is add a mode called Squad Stories. Compared to the first game I really cared about my squad members(the side characters you recruit into your squad for battle) their stories gave them life and made them feel alive and not just pawns to throw away. If you are on the fence about getting valkyria chronicles 4 I recommend getting it if you want a story/emotion rich story set in a fantasy ww2 genre. I will go as far to say that I believe personally Valkyria Chronicles 4 is better than the first game.\n",
      "1843165 1 I know other people are having problems with this game such as crashes and such but I must say this game is really fun if you look past that. Sure its not fun to crash in a game but for me its been very minor only times it has crashes was when I try retrying a level I messed up on which is very rare for me to retry a level so its not a major problem and I can live with it. As for gameplay it does seem a bit simple and bland at times but its not bad its alright. The game itself is very addicting making me want to 100% it which im about 54% done with the achievements at the time of this review. The graphics are pretty decent for a port and the art style is pretty cute. I will give this game a 7/10 cause its not reall bad nor is it really good  its a decent game that if you look past the crashes its pretty adictive.\n",
      "1843165 1 All i have to say is this is the best game ive ever played if you have extra money and dont know what you want to spend it on i would say pick this up it has one of the best story's in video games imo.\n",
      "1843165 1 I love this game it has a intresting plot and great atmosphere the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is on point. There is some minor gameplay bugs i noticed but for the most part they arnt game breaking and the only problem i have with the game so far is that sometimes when i start it up when im playing another game i get a black screen besides that i say its a amazing game definitly worth the money if you have people to play with if not then they have built in matchmaking so you can always have a team. My over all rating is 8/10\n",
      "1843165 1 This is one of the best games i ever played and its a must buy no other words are needed\n",

      "2352954 0 I played through siding with the scarlet chorous till i decided to turn on them, because they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy. Was a very good game, May find time to play it again sometime, the characters have great travling commentaries and you can really feel th at they are there with you. I may play this a second time, but, being that I never finish games it was truly a miracle I enjoyed this enough to see it through to the end, which, I didn't even realize was the end as its quite a cliff hanger in a way. I hope they develop a second to let you expand on your original campaign as the real map is much larger than the area we are in for this game.\n",
      "2352954 0 This was surprisingly entertaining. Its pretty much a blatant ripoff of an oldschool/current StarCraft mod, I forget what it was called, same premise of 1v1 lane or 3v3, pick units, upgrade, use abilites, upgrade extractors, etc. Really enjoyed the time I played, could see myself delving into it if the development progresses well and it remains entertaining. Its nice not having direct control of the tropps, gives me more of a leader type feeling.\n",
      "2352954 1 Very solid indie game, gives you exactly what it says it does. The graphics arent phenomenal but they work, overall worth its price.\n",
      "2352954 1 I disagree with those that say if you like shadowrun returns, dragonfall, etc.  that you'll like this...  it's nothing at all like them, doesn't stay true to shadowrun content other then the cyberpunk anesthetics and races. I can't believe this was let through after the excellent efforts by hair brained studios. these other guys don't apparently even know what shadowrun was..  the sega genesis shadowrun is much better even than this. (it was great to begin with, but even with its age. this game is sloppy, unprofessional, and non-canon to the SR world\n",
      "2352954 1 I got this in early access and can honestly say that I'm not disappointed in the least with its progress and release. This is a very solid game, features a classic aesthetic, and is very entertaining if you like this type of turn based strategy and \"base building\"(in the loosest sense, clear ruins, place buildings, pretty much like xcom)game.\n",
      "2352954 1 Excellent card game with a gritty narrative(while meaningless), great strategic gameplay, and an overall new feel to it, thats is when compared to most magic/heathstone copy card games. So, This is nice if you enjoy the genre.\n",
      "2352954 0 Harebrained Studios are masters of their craft. and I have sincere desire and hope that they will continue their foray into the Shadowrun Universe. I can't believe catalyst let their franchise that was done soo stunningly by HBS be butchered in the Shadowrun Chronicles, by whatever sub-par company took over. This is the pinnacle Shadowrun game for the PC and I would recommend it to anyone, I'm not much for finishing games, or, being nostalgic, but, HBS was able to take me right back mentally to Shadowrun when it was released on Sega. These 3 HBS games go above and beyond that, and I implore the company to please, revisit shadowrun.\n",
      "2352954 0 Much better and more worthwhile than the other DLC\n",
      "2352954 0 OMG i tried and tried and tried to like this game, but, it has some of the stupidest design decisions/♥♥♥♥ ups possible. It is an immensely frustrating game about ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that doesn't even tell you what ito do. This is by far one of the worst selections I've made on a game in a long ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. I should have gone for the refund. I could stab myself in the face and still have more fun then I did in this terrible cofusing(and I did manage to get through a lot of missions, even without it telling me why or what or who). Hopefully the developer takes a good long look at their product and make sure they aren't this stupid a second time.\n",
      "2352954 1 like other customers, I will purchase it because It does look well implemented and I support the company, but, this a really stupid dl. Personally not being from around total war to know that this awas a policy, I was stupid enough to actually assume a Total War game(based on perhaps the name and/or premise would have included bloodshed, but, not so apparently :). Okay, perhaps I should have done some resrearch? I dunno, At least they are only stealing 3$. Hell we should all just thank god 2k has nothing to do with this. Believe me, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ companies can always find a reason to charge money for anything.(Does you charater need noses?, Yes, noses to smell! We are offering this exclusive dlc for the low price of only 29.99 give the finest 3 shades of two exclusive types of noses(flat or not flat) (with another 15 vartions on the shading of those noses!!!(i know, were going crazy like a car salesman, come on down pick ypu favorite flat or non flat nose, in up to numerous shades of 3 different(DIFFERENT YOU SAY?) shades, Yes, so now, you can not only watch the finest fights in all the realms, but, isn't that an impressive nose that only you can see on you. TL:DR : long sarcastic rant about dlc practices, still choose to support the game despite such practices because the game is solid.\n",
      "3007801 1 Not much to say. Great narrator voice. Love the light/dark system in the game. Love the turn based combat and the classes that are available. The areas that are currently available are all well though out and have their own bosses and challenges. The price for the game is very affordable and you will definitely find yourself devoting many hours to beating it. 9/10.\n",
      "3007801 1 This game is very hard to judge. The game itself is very fun if you can get a large group of friends to play, or are lucky enough to queue into a game filled with decent players (goodluck). Even as a singleplayer experience I enjoyed this game immensely and think it was well worth it's miniature price tag.\n",
      "3007801 1 A charming roguelike with randomized levels and many (30+) skillsets to choose from.\n",
      "3007801 1 The Dark Souls series as a whole is really similar to a long drawn out con. You will find yourself drawn to playing it and enjoy it, before the game utterly beats you about the head senseless and you find yourself crying in a corner for it to stop. Then you realize you can roll in the game and suddenly it once again becomes the fairytale wonderland you always dreamed it to be.  In all seriousness, buy this game as it is very enjoyable while providing just the right amount of challenge.\n",
      "3007801 1 Gameplay: 9/10 (fun for everyone until you are stuck with an awful team, even then, still fun.) Visuals/Graphics: 8/10 (visuals are cartoony and decent. Hats.) Plot: N/A (no real plot: red vs blu, mann co., yada yada.) Music: 8/10 (decent music) Overall: 8.5/10 Recommended? Yes, especially now that it is free to play. Still my favorite first person shooter and I don't see any replacements coming up anytime soon.\n",
      "3007801 1 Gameplay: 7/10 (third person shooter with sword skills. Everyone tends to gravitate to Evan/Lela the katana and dual dagger users. I personally played Elena and watching people cry about my grenade launcher is what made this game fun.) Visuals/Graphics: 6/10 (player customization is null, maps looks ok, but character models are not up to par.) Plot: 3/10 (something about finding a new mineral called optimite... and companies fighting to control it. people play it for pvp, not so much for pve.) Music: 7/10 (kinda like electronic rock) Overall: 6/10 (fun in short bouts) Recommended? Maybe if you are bored.\n",
      "3007801 1 Gameplay: 8/10 (stealth was fun, seemed a little too easy with bugs here and there.

Yes, buy it on sale.\n",
      "3007801 1 A seemingly simple, but difficult to master sidescroll indie game. Will suck away many hours of your life when you have better things to do like studying for an exam the next day.\n",
      "3007801 1 Warning: If you love arpgs, then playing this game will cause you to lose thousands of hours of your life in the name of pure enjoyment.  This game is amazing due to the complexity and freedom you have with creating new and exciting builds. You will never find another game with a skill tree larger than this game. The end game maps are also very fun as you can easily adjust the difficulty to range from easy to impossible. Race events in this game are very competitive and definitely caters to the more skillful players. For those seeking a challenge, the game does have a hardcore league that offers you a 1 life policy for your character. For those who are looking for a casual experience, the standard league is your best bet. The game also offers separate 4 month leagues such as Domination and Nemesis that brings new properties of gameplay (e.g. Domination offers totems on maps that buff enemies until tagged by the player, after which is will buff you for a certain amount of time.) Overall, this game offers tremendous replayability and fun, engaging gameplay. Also, the cash shop offers only cosmetic changes to your character and additional stash space, so no pay to win!\n",
      "3431419 1 Awesome storyline! A lot of quests! Amazing combat system! Interesting npcs! Something like Baldur's Gate II\n",
      "3431419 1 Amazing!! many ways to achieve missions!\n",
      "3431419 0 I'm reviewing this game, I want to like it, but it's impossible! 1) Horrible servers! Servers keep you always at high latency, so you will never fully experience this game. Manly because it's mandatory for you to wait to the last moment to parry, at high latency this is impossible! 2) Horrible servers 2! Sometimes the performance suddenly drops to half, that makes impossible to play! 3) Bad optimization! The game is not optimize at all, it is a very beautiful game but you could not enjoy! People say this is server side! 4) Unbalanced! Weapons are not balanced at all! Polearms are way better then everything else! 5) Horses and archers! Horses and archers make this game so unpleasant, even more traps, they are so unbalanced! Horses animation sucks, even when it seems that a lance will not catch you, it catches! 6) Maps aren't good! Chivalry ones were way better and beautifully designed!\n",
      "3431419 1 Great game! Historically accurated, immersive, well made! earn every cent! very difficult!\n",
      "3431419 1 Besides people complains... Yeah the game has a weird mechanics and you will die all the time until study a little bit of it, but it's very fun to play and you have to work your opponent to kill it. The community is OK, better than the CS:GO one. If you can't stand bullying and trolling, better stay away from multiplayer games, and you could just ignore the chat. Good graphics, funny mechanics and elements, good maps, linux support, cheap! People just don't complains about hollywood swordfighting or fighting in general, wich is bizarre and has nothing to do with the real thing...  So this is just a funny game, not a swordfight simulator!\n",
      "3431419 1 This game is fantastic!! Positive points: Very tactic: run chrouch, lay down, aim! No aim on the screen, you have to ready your gun to fire with precision! Great Immersion! Beautiful Graphics! ------------------------------ Negatve Points: Very difficult multiplayer The maps have a very similar atmosphere\n",

POSITIVE POINTS: +Playability +Story +Funny dialogs NEGATIVE POINTS: -Bad support for linux amd cards -Crashes and strage behavior on windows -not so good graphics\n",
      "3431419 1 Well ported game! Runs smoothly under amdgpu (amd open source drive). On Vulkan it has a nice performance, but it's beta by now, so will get better! The game is similar to shadow of mordor, very playable, beautiful and immersive! it's a 9/10!\n",

      "4030277 1 It is a tower defense game + first person shooter at the same time. It's fun.\n",
      "4030277 0 It's a fun game, don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed this game back on the Xbox 360 and the PC version. There are 4 different classes, plus another 2 DLC classes, and it's a shooter with a leveling system that utilizes a skill tree. There are 3 different playthroughs, the last of which is heavily gear-dependent. The first two, however, you can get away with just about any playstyle with any gear, the second of which requires you to aim. IF YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME AND ONLY THE GAME, THEN CONSIDER THIS A POSITIVE REVIEW AND DON'T READ FURTHER. So why is this review negative? Simple, I am participating in a review bomb. Borderlands 3 is going to be a timed exclusive to the Epic Store, and there are various reasons why players disapprove of this. The review bomb has NOTHING to do with the quality of this game in particular. You're an adult; I'm sure you can determine if the cause of the review bomb is useful information to you or not when deciding to buy this game. My reason for the review bomb (which used to be positive to counter it): \"Ironically, that this misuse [review bombing] is possible and that Steam has no interest in correcting this misuse makes me kind of happy about 2k's decision and makes me want to reconsider Gearbox Publishing's current posture on the platform.\" - Rand Pitchford, CEO of Gearbox Software Really now? First off, Steam is a product, Valve is the company. Second, Valve has taken significant steps to counter review bombing. So what Randy has said was an outright lie. Not to mention that he is complaining that the hand that has fed him slapped him after biting it. He then goes to attack the fans and label them as \"trolls\" if they ever have concerns about this whole thing.\n",
      "4030277 1 I'm having fun. It's a simple JRPG. Have Genis and Raine in the back casting spells as they essential to doing well. Otherwise your guys will just run up and get themselves killed.\n",

      "4030277 0 I tried creating a Square Enix account (required to play the game), and they will not send me a confirmation email, so I'm stuck. I'm refunding this, don't waste your time.\n",
      "4030277 1 Game has an incredible story, and a very long one at that, though it lacks in side quests. It has complicated combat mechanics, leaving a VERY high skill cap, so you might not want to hop on the highest difficulty right away. The character development is incredible; they're hardly the same people from when you meet them as you progress through the game, but they still maintain their values the entire time. I looked around in the forums after beating the game, and found out it has Denuvo DRM. I'm not entirely sure what that is, but some have described it as \"intrusive.\" I would have to disagree, nothing intrusive came up during the entire time I played. Nothing stopped me from playing the game, not even a game crash. I only bring up the DRM since there are players that refuse to buy games with DRM by principle alone. Though I disagree with that sentiment, I will respect it. My specs: FX-6300 processor GTX 750 Graphics card 16 GB RAM\n",
      "4030277 1 Only problem really is that you need an EA account to use the DLC. As for actually playing the game, you will be fine without it. I never created an EA account. Too lazy :P It's important to mention that parts of the story are dependant on what actions you took in Mass Effect 1. So while you don't have to, I would recommend you play that first and don't delete your save.\n",
      "4030277 1 Very helpful and simple to use. Gives you many functions including the ability set a hotkey where you lock your cursor to a screen or a program window, preventing you from accidentally clicking on the other screen while playing a game with that kind of problem. It would be nice if the other task bar on the second screen was simply a drag and drop instead of putting  in the icons manually, but still simple to do.\n",

It's the same repetitive game. It is literally the same map as Far Cry 4 except with a few changes to scenery.\n",

      "126400 1 Hard and challenging WRPG with great storyline filled with war, politics, and conspiracies. The combat improved from the previous title but it's still awful. The part that I don't like is the side-quest is difficult to follow. Also, the minimap is stupid. 8,5/10\n",
      "261875 0 I very much like the concept of the game, but the novelty wears off and then it's just an FPS. And if you're doing an FPS, replayability depends on the gameplay. I'm sorry to say I felt Screencheat doesn't deliver enough in that department. Walking, aiming and shooting just doesn't go smoothly enough. As such it is an interesting idea, but not that great of a game.  You've got to applaud the courage to put out a four player local multiplayer PC game, though. We don't see enough of those.\n",
      "261875 1 Now here's an innovative game! Highly original gameplay divided over short, fast-paced rounds, that are sure to keep you and your friends on the edge of their seat. There's probably not that many people that have enough controllers to play with three or four players on their PC, but if you do, boy, you should buy this game. If only because it's not like anything you've played before. But note that the game is a tad less fun with only two players.\n",
      "261875 1 Great party game. It has fast-paced action and replayability similar to Mario Kart, but with an interesting take on the conventional gameplay often seen in the genre.  I'm not a great fan of the art style and I do feel the game's interface is clunky at times. It's also hard to distinguish between certain characters and for some maps it's hard to spot the proper route, even after a couple of rounds. But key component for any party game is strong gameplay and SpeedRunners has that in abundance. Although it's certainly not the perfect game, it is highly enjoyable.\n",
      "261875 1 Just this wonderfully offbeat mixture of gameplay elements. Truly a great game.\n",
      "261875 1 Already fun, but it's just starting to take shape. Certainly a very promising party game with a fresh take on the genre. Given how early in development the game currently is, it's quite an achievement that it's already this entertaining. Depending on the direction they take this, it could become anything from \"fun for a lazy afternoon\" to \"the party game you and your friends have been unknowningly waiting for\".  Given the current progress it could very well be the latter. But if it turns out to be the former, they'll have to drop the price for me to recommend it.\n",
      "261875 1 It's what you hoped the sequel to Sim City 4 would be. All of the city building fun you'd expect, minus the tedious micro-management and clunky interface EA made us grow accustomed to.  If there's one issue I have with the game, it would be its difficulty. The game starts of challenging, but once your city starts to take shape and you've managed to find some sort of balance, money will start rolling in and the hard part'll be over. The game is also a bit light on content, meaning you'll run out of new types of buildings to construct somewhere down the line.  Personally, it doesn't bother me that much. Watching your citizens go about their business and your buildings evolve is more than enough fun in itself. Managing the various aspects involved with city planning is a rewarding task and, due to the game's intuitive interface, a fun one as well. And luckily, there is a large scala of mods that improve the game by adding to the gameplay or content. You'll definitely want to shift through the most popular mods before you get started with the game. All in all, I'd say: play it.\n",
      "261875 0 Pick up a copy of Age of Empires II: HD and promptly fire up a multiplayer game, if you want to relive the old days and take a trip down memory lane. If you didn't play this game when it first came out back in 1999 though, you're unlikely to find anything interesting about this rework.  Ago of Empires II: HD features an entertaining mix of resource management and military combat, but many similar games that have been released since 1999 have better balanced gameplay, are better looking and likely cheaper as well. Interestingly enough, the HD version features all the original low-resolution textures and sounds, so the \"HD\" label is just refering to your monitor resolution (the original game being forced to an aspect ratio of 4:3). The game mechanics remain unchanged as well. So there's still lots of nostalgia there -- just not much more than that.\n",
      "261875 1 It looks, sounds and feels very fresh. Even just the way you walk around town, it's incredibly soothing. Sure you could run, but when you choose to walk somehow you instantly feel like an absolute badass. Just walking in the prairie, being all tough guy.  I just find that to be the most wonderful thing. How carefully must it've been designed to achieve that effect? It payed off. So far I've found playing Westerado to be an incredibly rewarding experience.\n",
      "280165 1 Last Encounter is fun, addictive, with cool music, beautiful graphics and pretty easy to use controls. It's rougelite, it's twin stick shooter, it's dynamic, but it also has a story (I didn't pay much attention tbh), several ships and characters to choose from and plenty of upgrades you can buy. This is basically top down version of Everspace and it does its job pretty well.  I didn't try co-op yet, so this is based on solo play. Co-op can just take it up a notch. :) Recommended for killing some time and little ships that try to pwn your ass.\n",
      "280165 1 Thank you, Somnium Games. Inked is beautiful. It's sad. It's heartwarming. It makes me wanna cry. It amazes me. Its music calms me. Its sound makes me chuckle (cute little footsteps). This is, by far, the most imaginative, innovative masterpiece of art I have seen since FEZ and Braid. The way it's done is superb! I've seen no bugs so far, I enjoyed every second of it and only little gripe I have is right thumbstick can be really slow on moving the objects. It would be cool if it could accelerate as you move it. But don't miss this beautiful work of art that has captured my heart. :) <3 <3 <3\n",
      "280165 1 It's pay 2 win, but it's still fun. I didn't play ranked yet cause I don't have a suitable deck for it, but I think it will keep me occupied for some time now. But I'm talking about Free part, no way I'm gonna pay big dollars for those crates and boosters. :) It's similar to Hearthstone, Magic and all other card games out there.\n",
      "280165 1 So basically it's a tower defense game but it is soooo dynamic, addictive and fun that it hurts! I got this for almost nothing in Humble Bundle, but it's worth even the full price. Music is fantastic, kind of electronica easy listening ambiental. Art style is really interesting, the game plays very smooth.  You have a research tree and you can buy upgrades before every mission that will help you finish it so it's nothing new, but it's very addictive. I can calmly recommend this game.\n",
      "280165 1 Fun, fun fun! This game was a pleasant surprise and I got it with this DLC that adds to the game and it's unique feel and design. Music is also very cool. Kinda modern, electronic...\n",
      "280165 1 Fun if you're fan of the series. Otherwise, perfectly average MMO.  I don't like expensive DLC concept. It's not worth it and there are better MMOs out there.  Still, as I said, if you're a fan of the series you will like it. I won't give it a thumbs down.\n",
      "280165 1 Excellent RTS, highly likeable characters, interesting art design. Anyway, it's fun and I can recommend it! :)\n",
      "280165 1 I'm not that far in to judge and some people had issues with later stages, but so far, the first impression of the game has been good. Music is country style, very easy to listen to, graphic style is excellent, gameplay is fun and roguelike, but I really like this. Reminds of Don't Starve, of course, and it's fun so far.\n",
      "280165 1 You no mess with Lo Wang!!! It's a classic. :)\n",
      "280165 1 Fun survival top down game. A bit less hardcore then it's predecessor.  But yeah, I would recommend it, this ♥♥♥♥ is dope. At least try it out for 2 hours and make your own decision.  Stupid Mars. Always bad things happening there... :(\n",
      "1518820 1 Not only has the technology behind the Frostbite engine been improved but the multiplayer shows major signs of improvement and a willingness by DICE to push the boundaries further. The single player campaign, despite feeling like an added component to a 100% multiplayer focused experience, is much more streamlined and interesting this time around. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is a great game but it also does what many games with a ’2’ next to their name fail to do; improve. This one is the best game of Battlefield series !\n",
      "1518820 1 Hitman: Absolution absolutely nails the modern gaming trope of presenting oodles of gameplay choice. It would be an insult to polarise Absolution into 'stealth' or 'action', where the real beauty of the game is found in the fertile grey area in between. My Verdict : Buy it and try the legend (  Agent 47 )\n",
      "1518820 1 Dishonored injects new life into stealth actions and their sophisticated worlds. Awesome work in every detail. My Verdict : Buy it ;)\n",
      "1518820 1 A gorgeous, utterly immersive and hugely satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest video game narratives of all time. Having Elizabeth be a stranded FPS protagonist, with no problem killing anyone in her way seems lazy. And taking away her unique ability to open tears into other times and places? Come on, how awesome would it have been to have opened up a tear and have an enemy get creamed by a car, or a speeding train? Seems like a massive missed opportunity. At least they managed to bring the story to a conclusion. But Elizabeth still going to be my best character in BioShock.\n",
      "1518820 1 Burial at Sea brings you back to Rapture, again as Booker DeWitt who, again, meets Elizabeth in a completely independant-yet-linked new storyline. Graphics : Burial at Sea is absolutely jaw-dropping even on the lowest graphic settings. Every location is richly appointed with a hundred little details, a hundred things to see and investigate and wonder about. Music and Sound : The voice acting is superb. Elizabeth, in particular, shines with her more mature undertones and glacial regard for Booker. Even the Splicers you encounter are masterfully performed. The music is on par with the sound effects, providing competent accompaniment to the sojourn through Rapture. Lasting Appeal : You may want to revisit this a few years now for nostalgia's sake but a two-hour DLC is not going to keep anyone but a gold fish preoccupied for terribly long.\n",
      "1518820 1 Amazing atmosphere of \"Columbia\". Graphics of the game are awesome. Booker Dewitt very mysterious character cooperating with Elizabeth which is best female assistant ever . Fable = 10/10 Character = 10/10 Graphics = 10/10 <3\n",
      "1518820 1 At the end, what matters is not if CS:GO is innovative or more of the same than CS: Source, what counts is if it's fun. And CS:GO couldn't be better in this regard.\n",

      "2352954 0 It is rather dull and boring. Despite having this hacking device I felt rather underpowered to the point where I felt easily out matched by only a few enemies. The upgrade system makes almost no sense having to buy two explosive upgrades to buy the ability to do a close combat take down of armored enemies for example. Cars handle poorly with the radio music selection being tiny. I would say wait for a good sale on this game before considering picking it up.\n",

      "4030277 0 KF1 is still better than KF2. The pros to this game being that it is decent as a $30 game, revamped melee, unique zed mechanics, weapon discounts are gone, and the addition of skills. Cons: TWI has no transparency and never listened to the community except for that one time the reviews tanked and they got desperate. SWAT: The 9th perk that was meant to be a tanky commando with smg's is actually squishier, requires more ammo to kill trash, and instead of the commando's ability to extend Zed time and reveal stalkers to the team, he gets to stun large zeds with his grenades. A really crappy clone. At least he can kill large zeds with the kriss if he has a flashbang. Lots of people really wanted a swat shield. Nope, that ♥♥♥♥ will got to zerk. Survivalist: A literal clone of the other 9 perks. It does not have its own weapons and its skills are taken from other perks (in other words: no unique skills). The community had so many amazing ideas for a 10th perk, and TWI went with this trash. Zedconomy aka microtransactions: I recently thought that the zedconomy was meant to fuel the development process even further, resulting in great new content. Alas, since TWI took the easy way out and neglected the community, the only purpose the zedconomy accomplished was wasting valuable development time to tweak it, time that could have been spent on a real 10th perk, bugfixes, ect. This is the best the game will get: The reason TWI wanted KF2 rather than updating KF1 and slapping microtransactions on it was because of a change in the game engine. The problem was that TWI did want to update KF1, but couldn't add new content without amping system requirements. Now that they have switched engines, they can load up assets when they are needed instead of at the beginning of the game, allowing them to potentially add new content forever. Unfortunately, updates have been getting worse until they added literally nothing with the release of the survivalist. Any new updates they put out for KF2 now will most likely be half-♥♥♥♥♥ and add nothing to the game, unless Swift Brutal Death adds new maps [grats on making the dev team btw ;) ]. Teasing the community: TWI showcased the fire axe, M32, and have released a workshop mod where you can use the husk cannon with the use of in-game cheats several months ago. These weapons still have not made it into the game, and probably never will. Casualized as hell: The crap that you get away with on HoE are things that you cannmot do on KF1 on hard mode. Ever try running up to a siren? You survive that ♥♥♥♥. Want to outrun a raging scrake as a demo? No problem, he slows down a bunch when he attacks. Fleshpounds no longer deal a ton of damage when they are enraged, but breaking LOS will no longer reset his timer. The zeds hit like wet noodles; armor has become useless as a result. What did you expect? This game is going to be available for PS4 users. Gotta make this playable on controller. Never EVER invest in early access. That is a critical lesson that TWI has taught me. If you enjoyed KF2, then KF1 would make you question why you ever got KF2. Download ScrN as well for a ton of extra content.\n",
      "4030277 0 Little Kuriboh would have finished the Yugioh Abridged series before this game gets another update. This game is early access, and it is going to stay that way. Only get this game if you are going to make a profit off of the steam cards.\n",

      "280165 1 Very fun game that partially captures Dungeon Keeper spirit. Music, sound and graphics are really top notch, gameplay is easy enough to grasp, the game is highly addictive so I say anything but recommend it. I got it on Steam sale, but recent Humble free promotion reminded me on the quality of this game.\n",
      "280165 1 Masterpiece! I played this back in '95. but I still enjoy installing it and playing it from time to time.  Man, I grew up on this! Level design, music, everything captures that Star Wars \"look & feel\".  Recommended, especially when it's on sale.\n",

      "280165 1 This game is sooo fun! It's not the best RTS in the world but it's good enough and it has all the memorable characters from movies, not to mention original John Williams score. Fantastic tracks like \"Into the trap\", \"Duel of the fates\", \"The Asteroid Field\" just add to the atmosphere.  Graphics are outdated, but I don't mind. It was cool 15 years ago when it was released.  IF you are a Star Wars fan, I recommend this.\n",
      "280165 1 I expected another mindless shooter, but I got a really nice singleplayer experience (it was on my wishlist for quite some time, but I got it as a Christmas present from a friend). I was pleasantly surprised by game optimization, smoothness, graphics, sound, level design. This game is fun and it captures some of that nostalgic Doom experience. I don't care about multiplayer, so this review and score is based only on singleplayer campaign and singleplayer modes. I can recommend it to every FPS lover, but even to people who are not into FPS genre anymore, because this game is dynamic, tense and fun. Soundtrack is also going really nice with the game and adds to the atmosphere ranging from kind of ambiental to heavy metal.\n",
      "280165 1 It starts small and gets bigger and bigger, and as a game developer myself, I consider this game to be cute as hell! So many options from scripting and programming to developing your own console. I played it when it first came out, then later at my friend's house and finally got my copy on Steam. Highly recommended and fun game!\n",
      "280165 1 Fantastic game that I loved back when it first came out and I love it still.  Basically it's a mixed genre game. When you start it you have casual amoeba swimming game. Then you evolve and go to land where you go around eating fruits or other animals until you advance to tribal stage. Tribal stage becomes a kind of a lightweight RTS where you attack other tribes, create tools, equip them to your tribe members. After advancing to Civilization age, you start to build cities, defenses, vehicles (land, air, naval) and it's even more of RTS. And then you go into space... :)  The best part of the game is definitely Creature Creator though. It's easy to use and you can make  many different cute creatures, only your imagination is the limit. Spore is a nice game, and additional pack add to the game but are optional. You can even play with the music and change it during gameplay (different beats and stuff). It's not the best game ever, but I can recommend it without any problems, especially if you're into building stuff (Sims, Sim City...)\n",
      "28 1 Should have stayed pre-order imo but on the other hand like someone else in this comment section said, it can be great for people who missed the opportunity to pre-order the game.

      "28 1 \n",
      "28 0 Was a great game a number of years ago but since the developers have added many microtransactions and crates. The game is lacking a lot of what made it fun back then. I'd recommend it but I don't see it getting any better soon and rather getting worse.\n",
      "28 1 One of the few games that made me cry many times while playing. This game is VERY emotional.\n",
      "28 1 Kill zombies with friends! While this game does include a story, most disregard it and jump right into the game. If you choose to do this, it will not impact your experience unless you want a story driven experience: It's very hard to find lobbies that follow the story now.\n",
      "28 1 A Sandbox-Game with multiple community driven gamemodes. Including, but not limited to: Trouble in terrorist town, DarkRP, and PropHunt. This is genuinely a sandbox game that will never get boring regardless of its age. It is 100% worth the price, even including Counter-Strike: Source. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to buy Counter-Strike: Source alongside this game as a content pack. Many of the community addons use the textures and a number of props used in the Source version of Counter-Strike making it almost required to play any of the gamemodes.\n",
      "28 1 Fight other capital ships in a Sector PvP. Lots of fun and amazing graphics!  While the game does have microtransactions and can feel like a grind to buy new ships, it is definitely worth a try for anyone interested in the game or likes Sci-Fi games. Happy Flying!\n",
      "28 1 This is how VR was meant to be used. Love the idea and implementation but would like to see more than four people per lobby.  Great Job so far Developer!\n",
      "280165 1 The ONLY bad thing with this game was that it was released the same day as Metal Gear Solid V which ruined their sales.  It's a fantastic, action pumped bloodbath, set in the open world of Max Rockatansky aka. Mad Max and it's just amazing! Gameplay is similar to other 3rd person games like Tomb Raider. It has RPG elements where you upgrade your armor and weapons and also unlock parts of the game world to gain bonuses. Get that V8 Interceptor! Graphics are stunning!!! Music is good, sound is also fantastic. This game is worth your money, especially if you like to hunt for achievements because it will give you good 80+ hours. I didn't finish all the achievements yet because I don't care, but I still got almost 90 hours for my money which is well worth. Highly recommended! :thumbs:\n",
      "280165 1 Damn this is fun as hell!  And this game will slap you, spit on you and shoot you in the head at the end. And I love it! Reminds me a bit of FTL with that hardcore feeling. Recommended. 10/10 I would visit Mars again.\n",
      "280165 1 Hmm I played it during Early Access but now that time is not counted.  Anyway, the game is free, so go ahead and try it.  Ships are really cool, design is fantastic, they \"feel\" massive and the combat is tactical and dynamic, it's pure PvP with capital ships. Graphics I don't need to talk about, but I do have to say that sounds effects are very cool. People compare it to Dreadnought, but why? This one is free, try it, and then you can check out Dreadnought. :)\n",
      "280165 1 Fantastic roguelike adventure! You will die and you will hate the world but the game will push you to try again and again and again. I decided to just try it and I clocked 4 hours in one play. Recommended and available in Humble Bundle at the time. 10/10 would slash my wrists again.\n",
      "280165 1 It's fun for now, reminds me a bit of old Master of Orion which makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.  It has a lot of potential, I'm looking forward to Early Access progress. Do I recommend it? It's stable and fun, but I didn't play much at the moment. I do recommend it, you can always refund it if you don't like it, but I will update this review at a later time.  By the way, this is the first 4X game where I actually don't wanna play as a human, but some other race. :)\n",
      "280165 1 Very fun Candy Crush alternative, fast paced, nice graphics and highly addictive. Don't say I didn't warn you. :D Absolutely recommended because after all the clones we've seen, Ember Strike introduces real time gem battle which is a breath of fresh air and very cool concept. :)\n",
      "280165 1 This is cool because it gives you something to do while you drink for real. But don't get carried away. :D\n",
      "280165 1 Fun as every other title in the series. There are cons and pros to every Tropico, but all in all it's and addictive and fun building sim pumped with humor. :) El Presidente for the president!  Oh wait...\n",
      "280165 1 Less then 2 hours in, but already so much fun! It's not as good as the first one, for now, but it's close enough to be called a sequel to Mafia. We'll see about the third one when it comes out. Juding by Gamescom presentation, it could be cool.  Anyway, graphics are nice, gameplay is fluid, voiceovers very good, not much to complain so far. If anything changes, I will update the review. Update: I'm unable to finish it. I need to  , but the game either glitches in the middle of the mission and crashes or loads indefinitely after I finish it and never saves the progress. I've done this three times, I searched the internet and many people reported problems on this mission, it's sad that they didn't patch that up after all this time. It would probably work if I tried again and again, but I have other games to play. Why still thumbs up? Because I got good 15 hours out of it. And I'll watch the ending on YouTube.\n",
      "280165 1 I liked old ones, and I got old ones in the Early Access package so I'm fine with it. New one is cool, not quite like the old classics, but good nevertheless. I have about 40 hours in it, mostly offline cause I played it on vacation, but I can say it's fun, plenty of races to choose from, interesting animations, good graphics and solid sound.  All in all, it's a nice 4X game and I can recommend it to everyone that likes Civilization, Stellaris or Galactic Civ...\n",

      "28 1 So, after about two hours of playing I've come up with this: Definitely worth a buy if you liked the first game + episodes but this game feels incomplete with a few transition scenes having millisecond glitches, etc. Not that big of a problem but takes away a little in a way I can't explain. Loving the characters + story so far! EDIT: Bonus Episode shed lots of tears. ;(\n",

      "28 1 Why is this game still 64$?\n",
      "28 0 Game is broken beyond belief. Punished players for an exploit that was reported a year ago because the developers didn't listen. Lots of RNG (random) in this game and a lot of players were fed up with it. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone right now, not after the events this morning.  --IGNORE REVIEW-- Pros: -Good Community. -Open World. -No Pay2Win. (Excluding DLC) -Great Graphics. -Amazing Sound. -Support team is amazing! (Refunds ship if you die in a weird way, etc) Cons: -Ships are difficult. -Exploration is usually press a button and wait. -Combat Logging. (Player force closes game to abandon a situation) -Servers. (Specifically Instancing) Other: I've seen a lot of people say this game is difficult and you really need someone in the inside to get started. No ♥♥♥♥. Have you ever played any Elite game before? It's supposed to be difficult. Conclusion: This is a great game with a huge community of factions, etc. I'd recommend getting this game if you have ever played the other Elite games in the past and liked them. It is hard to get started in the game and It's not for a casual gamer but once you have a gotten another ship orientated to what you want to do, it's a lot of fun.\n",
      "28 1 Some guy forced me to eat a banana and I died. 9/10\n",
      "28 1 The borg forced me to eat a Banana, I died.\n",
      "28 1 Would I recommend this game? Yes and no.. The competitive community is quite toxic and unforgiving. If that's why you want this game I   recommend it. Now, if you are thinking about playing one of the other modes or on community servers, I   TOTALLY recommend this game! There are TONS of community servers that offer alternative gamemodes such as; Zombie Escape, Surf, Jailbreak, etc!\n",
      "28 1 -7 Days to Die Review- ------------------------ Pros: -Very fun with friends. -Multiplayer & Solo. -Interesting game mechanics. Cons: -MP is worthless unless you play with friends. -Building in this game can be hard. -Price is a bit high. Overall: 7/10 Great game but lacks many good mechanics which make up a survival game.\n",
      "280165 1 Fun and charming. :)  Just like this review which is not actually a real review, just a statement that I find this game fun and charming.  Fun, right? :)\n",
      "280165 1 Very fun game, needs a bit more balancing in late stages where you don't really have real money sinks. But excellent design, good music, very fun aspect that reminds me of Plague Inc. Recommended! :)\n",
      "280165 1 Sad, atmospheric and fantastic emotional experience. A really good game which left a deep impression on me.\n",
      "280165 1 Bugs? Yes. Memory leaks? Yes, after you play for 2 or more hours. But is it worth it? Yes, it's Fallout. It's fun, it's huge, modding community is fantastic, story is great so far (75+ hours in), side quests are interesting.  Companions are cool too, they have depth, and so far I really like the game. I'm playing vanilla, not Far Harbour. And I use some mods like Caliente's Beautiful Bodies and some home building improvements...  Recommended.\n",
      "280165 1 Very fun game, and even if I don't like these DLC's I'm happy with the base game. :)\n",
      "280165 1 The Red Solstice is a gamer killer game. :) Hard, tense, with atmospheric soundtrack, this one is equally good in single player and multiplayer. But there's nothing better than running around with friends, trying to survive on harsh Mars terrain with so many enemies zerging on you. This reminds me on Dead Nation game that I loved playing in co-op but TRS is much bigger and better.  Highly recommended. I bought it back in Early Access so the price was lower but there was no singleplayer at the time. Now it's a complete game with fantastic and responsive dev team and I hope it will get all the attention it deserves. Not to mention really good price! :)\n",
      "280165 1 This game is so creative, funny and brilliant! I got it on a sale for less than 2€ but if I knew how good was it, I would pay the full price. Overwhelmingy positive about this. 10/10 Would throw myself out of the window again! :) P.S. I would just like more missions... :)\n",
      "280165 1 Fun, dangerous, and I really like the sense of exploration in this thing.  And I'm scared. Very scared. :-/\n",
      "280165 1 Fantastic atmosphere, fantastic sound, ships.... Come on, it's Elite! Mostly a remake of old Elite, but with stunning graphics, music and new goodies, and Horizons should bring it to a whole new level. Watch some videos on YouTube before you decide to buy it, because it's not for anyone. This is a hardcore game so I wouldn't recommend it to casual players, though. But is it an amazing space sim? Without a doubt. Update: I just nominated it for Steam's Whooooa award. :D\n",
      "280165 1 This game is so simple yet so fun. I cannot explain it, but it's highly addictive. I mean, driving small cars and playing soccer with the oversized ball? Sounds stupid. But actually it's dynamic, tense and fun, especially in online play.  You can unlock cars, decals, tires, painjobs, stuff like that, you can also play training, exibition, seasons and of course multiplayer. I have it on both PC and PS4 and I have to say, it's much easier to play with controller than keyboard.  Anyway, yes, I would recommend this because it's pure fun!\n",
      "28 1 Very fun game to play. The only thing that I don't like about this game is the fact that it starts getting very boring after a while.  But if you like zombie games (like me), you should upgrade to gold. You won't regret it.\n",
      "28 1 A great Sandbox game that you currently can play Creative or Survival. This game is still in Early access which means it has it's small problems but is still work a look. I've had a lot of fun with this game and anyone that likes space games will too.\n",
      "28 1 How did I get 250 hours in this game?  😉\n",
      "280165 1 Fantastic, intelligent, brilliant and with a lot of spirit, this has to be, beside Fez, one of the best platformers I have ever played. Highly recommended if you wannt use your brain. :) Art style is also beautiful, music pleasant.\n",
      "280165 1 This game, althought it's more of a narrative experience then game, is fantastic! I enjoyed it, along with Extras that go beautifully with the story. Fantastic soundtrack, nice art design, I can just recommend it.\n",
      "280165 1 Short but interensting opening of this interactive thriller. Reminds me of Saw series. A bit short, took me less than 50 minutes to complete episode 1. Still, I can recommend it at 60% off.\n",
      "280165 1 Don't know why but I love this thing. It's fun and addictive.\n",
      "280165 1 Me like this.  This is arcadish, but fun space game. Devs are also active in forums which is a big plus.  If you're not into hardcore space sims, this might interest you.  Recommended.\n",
      "280165 1 I'll keep it simple since this is Early Access build review and will update it as the game progresses. Pros: + Responsive and active devs (this is most important thing in Early Access titles and not seen often) + Constant sense of impending doom (Battlestar Galactica kind of thing) + Beautiful graphics (guys really nailed it in Unreal engine) + Bridge view (you feel like a capital ship captain) + RPG element (Officers level up skills and become better with time) + Very big map + Fantastic music!!! (No wonder since it's composed by Jack Wall - Mass Effect series) Cons:  - Ugly UI - I guess guys will work on that, it's fully functional now, I'm just talking about cosmetics.  - Fight can be a bit dull sometimes. In bigger fights you need to micromanage weapon and shield frequences faster and that's better. I won't take game balance as a minus since it's in development, but I should mention it here. Currently, the game is really hard cause it often happens that after a fight you've won, you send your injured officers to repair ship or in sick bay and then get attacked by two or three ships. Of course that leads to death since you don't have avaialable officers to take their positions on the bridge and you are doomed. This will be changed as the game will be tweaked.  If you love Battlestar Galactica as a story, you will like this. Your homeworld is destroyed and you have a capital ship with 10k civilians and need to run away from Scorn and find a new homeplanet. If you love FTL, this is basically FTL in 3D space, more or less. I loved FTL and this was familiar since the moment I started playing. If you don't hate Early Access and consider yourself a patient, mature gamer, give Into the Stars a chance.\n",
      "280165 1 Too bad. It's a solid game today, together with Teladi Outpost DLC, but it was crap when it was released. I can recommend it now, it's a nice empire building space sim.  I still think it's not worth full price so get it on Steam Sales or Daily Deals.\n",
      "280165 1 Folk Tale looks beautiful, it has charm, it has soul, music is fantastic, it's pretty complex considering you can research ton of things. It's similar to Age of Empires but with better graphics, more charm and better music and much more complexity and depth. What's there not to like? Not to mention one huge thing I realized while playing this. There was NO game in my life that I played in this genre in which I actually CARED about my peasants. I know them, I feel for them, I don't won't them getting hurt. They progress through the game, they have their inventories so I can gear every peasant individually, they have experience levels, it's like massive city builder RPG.  Fun, addictive, charming and innovative and I just scratched the surface! Highly recommended!\n",
      "280165 1 This might be Early Access game, but it reminds me when we first started in Early Access with our Starpoint Gemini 2. Community is everything. Prison Architect has a fantastic and helpful community and that's really something. The game itself has so much charm that I can just praise them and compare them to golden Bullfrog times when Molyneux released hits like Theme Park and Theme Hospital. It's fun, it's complex, it has spirit.  I didn't had any bugs or crashes whatsoever in almost 15 hours of gameplay so I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loved old Dungeon Keeper, Theme series and was watching Oz or Prison Break. :)\n",
      "280165 1 Ok I tried it during free weekend and yes, it's better and bigger than any Tropico so far. El Presidente strikes again. I managed to research everything, win election after election fair and square, modernize my island, have nice relations with all big powers (USA, Russia, China, EU and Middle East), and I played for more than 100 years now.  Highly addictive and funny game. Recommended!\n",
      "280165 1 Beautiful, intelligent, funny, creepy, artistic, addictive are just some of the words to describe Don't Starve. After trying this one, Don't Starve Together seems like a next logical move.  On my first run, I sruvived for 20 days and proud of it. I was killed by a pack of penguins, go figure. :-/ Highly recommended!\n",
      "280165 1 Homeworld 1 and 2 are still the best RTS games out there. They were way ahed of their time when they were released and they are still amazing. Epic tactical battles in 3D enviroment, fantastic music, fantastic ship design. Gearbox made a nice remaster and I can recommend it. I didn't had any problems so far, but it seems some people did so check your recommended configuration before buying it.  Atmosphere in this game is also worth mentioning. It's not some dull zerg-rush RTS, it has interesting story (HW1 story better then HW2) and it's definately worth playing. If you're an old player, then you'll want to bring back memories and if you're new, believe me, in all these years I still haven't found better RTS. Mothership is standing by...\n",
      "280165 1 The game is fun, with interesting RPG element. The only problem is that sometimes computer has way more luck then me and beats me before I can even press a button.  But since it's free, give it a shot if you want to relax. :)\n",
      "280165 1 I got this today for review for croatian gaming portal and couldn't wait to lay my hands on it. So after a few tries, some ups and downs and one unpleasant Fluffy encounter, I decided to share my thoughts. :) First of all, unlike all those boring zombie survivals, this concept is excellent. From graphics, atmosphere, music... And it will just get better since it's early alpha.  My first Early Access game that I bought was Starpoint Gemini 2. And I'm thankful for it cause the devs were, and still are, so active and friendly to the community that they actually showed everyone what Early Access is all about.  It seems devs are reading these forums too, and I'm glad for it.  Things I'm missing at the moment is map (Ihave that awesome guide someone posted along with the map and it really helped me), but I know map will come laters.  I had NONE crashes and NONE performance issues whatsoever. The game is, at least for me, perfectly stable and smooth. Good work on that considering it's still alpha.  Highly recommended and I can't wait for future updates and features! :)\n",
      "280165 1 Excellent story, nice setting and plenty of things to do. From killing redcoats, turning the tide of war, to naval combat and upgrades of your weapons and ship. Trading also plays a nice part of money making and there is a nice treasure search which ads to this game and makes it the best AC up to Black Flag. Recommended.\n",
      "280165 1 I finally finished Sleeping Dogs yesterday and I have to say I really like the game. Nice story mode (watch Hong-Kong movie Infernal Affairs for more in-depth look on Triad) which was pretty intense, interesting side missions (still didn't finish them all), amazing graphics (especially on rainy nights), excellent sound and soundtrack. United Front Games and Square Enix didn't dissapoint. Combat system is interesting and takes some time to used to, but when you master all kung-fu moves you'll be unstoppable (gather Jade statues as soon as you can cause it will greatly boost your performance in combat). Well, throughout the game, no matter how good you are, patience will be your biggest friend when fighting a group of mobs. :) Don't forget to download High Resolution Texture Pack (free DLC) which will really bring the game to higher level.  Also, if you're lazy, you can purchase Top Dog Silver Pack (1,49€) and Top Dog Gold Pack (2,49€) for a quick XP boost, which will instantly give you many skillpoints to enhance your abilities and access to many wardrobe options. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. It's a fun open world third person action game in the asian setting which does have some weaknesses (missions are sometimes repetative; chase enemy - kill enemy) but, all in all, it a fun game and I don't think you'll regret it.  It should be available on Steam sales for a nice price (I got it for cca 6€ a few months ago) so keep it on radar.\n",
      "280165 1 With its huge open world, interesting combat system and tons of main and side quests, this game is a big recommendation. It's similar to Skyrim in some segments but it kept it's own spirit and interesting story.  With expansion pack you're in it for more than a hundred hours of content. Not to mention amazing graphics considering this was not a project as big or expensive as Skyrim.  Music is also very pleasant and it ads to the atmosphere. I want that soundtrack in CD quality.  So, all in all, if you can buy this game, buy it. If you like old school RPGs, buy it. If you're not some lazy, spoiled kid, used to have everything pinpointed to you like in today's World of Warcfraft, buy it.\n"
