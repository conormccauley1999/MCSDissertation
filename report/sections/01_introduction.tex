\section{Overview and Motivation} \label{sec:Intro_Overview}

The video game industry is hugely popular and rapidly growing. In 2020, the industry generated over 179 billion US dollars in global revenue, an increase of 20\% over the previous year \cite{GamingIndustrySize}. The Steam platform, a video game distribution service, is the largest of its kind for PC users \cite{SteamLargestDistributor} with over 120 million active monthly users \cite{SteamMonthlyUsers} and a selection of over 60 thousand games \cite{SteamGameCount}.

This dissertation will use a relatively large collection of data gathered from the Steam platform consisting primarily of game reviews written by users and the social relationships among users to explore and investigate the gaming and social habits of said users and how the content of individual game reviews can influence and affect the popularity of games and the behaviour of other users.

We will examine the nature of the data gathered and focus on the distribution of reviews among users, the quality and length of reviews as well as the structure of the underlying social network. We will use state-of-the-art language representation models to process the text of game reviews and investigate their ability to predict, among other things, the polarity of the review and the length of time the user has played the game. We will also explore the potential influence particular users might have on the games that other users play and review and if this influence can be isolated from external factors and quantified.

Being able to determine the quality of game reviews as well as which reviews best represent public opinion could help predict the future success and popularity of a game soon after its release. Similarly, knowing how much social influence certain users wield could be used to predict the success of games upon review by said users. Particularly influential users could also be targeted by developers to advertise and promote their games in order to inflate their popularity.

\section{Dissertation Structure} \label{sec:Intro_Structure}

In chapter 2 the structure and functionality of both the Steam platform and the dataset will be described in greater detail. In chapter 3 the state-of-the-art in language representation models will be discussed while chapter 4 will outline our implementation and application of said models and chapter 5 will analyse and evaluate the results of those applications. In chapter 6 existing research into social influence in similar networks will be discussed and this research will be applied to our data in chapter 7 while the results will be examined in chapter 8. Chapter 9 will conclude the project by providing a final review of our findings and suggesting future work that could be done in this area.
